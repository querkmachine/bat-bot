# ðŸ¦‡ Mastodon Batbot

A simple bit o' code that uses GitHub Actions to post a random, freely distributable bat picture onto a Mastodon account once an hour.

Bats are neat as heck. After I left Twitter in favour of the fediverse, I missed having accounts like [@batshourly](https://twitter.com/batshourly) to give me frequent infusions of them good, good animals right into my eyeballs... so I made a Mastodon equivalent.

## Disclaimers

All images are taken from sources that are either public domain, Creative Commons licensed, or use some other free or copyleft license that allows for distribution with attribution. 

I've tried to keep the scope to photographs of actual, living bats. No illustrations, no museum exhibits, no bats that are dead, injured or in distress.

In cases where a bat is being directly handled by a person, I've done my best to ensure that the people involved are biologists, zoologists, veterinarians, or other professionals likely to know what they're doing (not just random people).

## Questions, queries, issues, etc.

If some metadata is incorrect, an image has been included that does not meet the standards set out above, or the imagery isn't licensed in the way I think it is, let me know and I'll remove it.
